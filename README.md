Will be making a video of myself demoing it.  Will also MAYBE make a video of myself reviewing the code.  This was just supposed be a fun simple project of learning how to use jframe and explore the MySQL API in java.  Don't know if I am going to update it as I will start school in a week and want to tackel other projects.
